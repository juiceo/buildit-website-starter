        This is the <head></head> section of your website.

        You probably should not touch anything that is above this comment, but let's look at what we have below:

        - This is where you can include CSS files, which are used to style your HTML.
        - This is where you can include JavaScript files, which are used to add interactivity to your HTML.
        - And do a bunch of other things, like setting the title of your page.

        Any file not listed here in the <head></head> section will not be included in your website, and won't do anything.
    -->
    <title>My website title</title>
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="./normalize.css">
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="./index.js"></script>
  </head>
  <!-- Below here is the <body></body> section of the website. 

    This is where you put all the content that you want to show on your website.
