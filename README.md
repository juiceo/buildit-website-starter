# Build It 2024 website starter

This is a really really basic website starter project that you can use to get started, if you've never built a website before.

#### What you need

- A code editor (I recommend installing [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- A browser (I recommend Chrome)

#### Instructions

To get this running on your computer, you can do the following:

##### 1) Download the folder as a ZIP file

##### 2) Open VSCode (or another code editor), and open the folder

#### What now? 

Now you can start building your website. Look through the files in the project to get an overview of what's there, and how everything works. I recommend you try to make some edits to the content, styles or Javascript logic and see what happens!
